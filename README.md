### Task
This project involves building an audio cutter tool similar to [VocalRemover Cutter](https://vocalremover.org/cutter) using the following stack:
- **Next.js** as the web framework.
- **Mantine UI** for designing the interface (Tailwind CSS is **not allowed**).
- The tool must be **serverless**, meaning it should operate entirely within the browser using JavaScript and Web APIs. No backend fetch requests are allowed.
- Functionalities should be implemented with Web APIs, and completing the UI is essential for evaluation.

### Requirements

1. **Framework**:
   - Use **Next.js** for the project structure and routing.
   - Build the layout and components using **Mantine UI**. Familiarity with this library is crucial for this assignment.

2. **Functionality**:
   - Replicate the **UI** and functionality of the audio cutter tool from [VocalRemover Cutter](https://vocalremover.org/cutter).
   - The tool should allow users to upload audio files and visually adjust the start and end points for cutting the audio.
   - Use **Web APIs** like `FileReader` and `AudioContext` for handling file input and audio processing.
   - All actions must take place **client-side**, without any backend server interaction.
   
3. **UI Design**:
   - Focus on building an intuitive and clean user interface using **Mantine UI** components.
   - Completing the landing page's look is crucial and will account for **60% of the evaluation**.
   - While the left-side button functionality (e.g., play/pause, volume) is not required, the UI for these controls is still necessary.

4. **Additional Guidelines**:
   - Ensure responsive design principles are applied using Mantine's grid system.
   - Use Mantine's built-in components for buttons, sliders, and any other UI elements where possible.
   - Do not use **Tailwind CSS**.

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Use of Mantine UI**: This is critical to the project, and failure to use Mantine will result in disqualification.
- **UI Completion**: The initial landing page look must be completed, accounting for 60% of the evaluation.
- **Left-side Button UI**: Though functionality is not required, the buttons on the left side must be designed and implemented.
